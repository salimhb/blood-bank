Today, January 11th, 2012 - a date which will live in infamy - <a href="http://railslove.com">Railslove</a> was suddenly and deliberately attacked by the dark forces of <a href="http://9elements.com">9elements</a>.
Railslove was at peace with that nation and looking toward the maintenance of peace. In a brutal attack 9elements took one of the Railslove team members as hostage while being on a friendly mission visiting their headquarters.
It will be recorded that the visit of the Railslove member took place on solicitation of 9elements - it is obvious that the attack was deliberately planned many days or even weeks ago.
Because of this circumstances we are forced to protect ourselves and have to free our team member.
I ask that Railslove declare that since the unprovoked and dastardly attack by 9elements on January 11th, 2012, a state of war has existed between <a href="http://railslove.com">Railslove</a> and <a href="http://9elements.com">9elements</a>.
<strong>Let <a href="http://www.paintball-borken.de/">Paintball Borken</a> be our battleground for this gigantomachia!</strong>
