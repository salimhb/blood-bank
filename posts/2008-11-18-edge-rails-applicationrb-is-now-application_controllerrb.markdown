<p>The file for the ApplicationController is now called /app/controllers/appliction_controller.rb - NO longer /app/controllers/application.rb
</p>
<p>
This is now in edge but I think it will not make it to the 2.2. release. (we will see this in 2.3) <br />
Be careful because this change currently breaks backwards compatibility and you need to rename it on existing projects on your own.
