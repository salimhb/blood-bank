For nerds, from nerds.

We've presented this projects a few times at <a href="http://webmontag.de">Webmontag KÃ¶ln</a> and <a href="http://devhousefriday.org">DevHouse Friday Chillout</a> @ <a href="http://www.papaya-cms.com/">Papaya</a> and <a href="http://www.millepondo.de/">Millepondo</a>. Now we have about <a href="https://github.com/Nerds/NerdPursuit/tree/master/questions">100 Questions in 14 different Topics (algorithms/ bash/ couchdb/ css/ culture/ flash/ grafix/ html/ http/ javascript/ php/ rails/ regex/ ruby/)</a> . But we're still missing many.

Beside creating new questions we're working on an offline game - and hey <a href="http://9elements.com/">9elements</a> brought to us - a real time nerd pursuit game - fuck yeah! (will be linked soon).
