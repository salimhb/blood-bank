It's been over a week since our crew, that is <a href="http://railslove.com/items/mike_poltyn">me</a>, <a href="http://railslove.com/items/jan_kus">Jan</a> and <a href="http://railslove.com/items/georg_leciejewski">Georg</a> went on a trip to the beautiful city of Wroc≈Çaw.

But, really, can you blame us? It was one hell of an action-packed weekend with bedazzling people, great presentations, amazing lightning talks, and astounding after parties!

Two great presentations I, personally, loved were: "<a href="http://mcdlr.com/rwd/">Responsive Web Design</a>" by <a href="https://twitter.com/drummerhead">Nicolas Barrera</a> and "<a href="http://blog.steveklabnik.com/posts/2012-02-27-hypermedia-api-reading-list">Designing Hypermedia APIs</a>" by Steve Klabnik.

Jan and Georg also made a presentation about some of the most interesting, absurd, or funny insights and moments they've experienced in past couple of years as programmers. <a href="http://get-out-of-the-trap.heroku.com/#1">Get out of the trap</a>!

Beside the regular presentations lightning talks were presented in the evening. Jan presented <a href="http://hackerspursuit-wroclove.heroku.com/#1">Hackerspursuit</a>, a web-driven competition between hackers to show who is <a href="http://www.hackerspursuit.com/">the best of the best</a>.

And probably the best lightning talk - "<a href="http://delete-your-code.heroku.com/">Delete your code</a>" by <a href="http://twitter.com/_tjeden">_tjeden</a> - was presented on the conference! If you use git, don't be afraid to delete your code! Just do it! you do have git history, so don't comment out your code - just delete it!

<small>On the last day, we were also visited by <a href="http://railslove.com/items/josh_kalderimis/">Josh Kalderimis</a> during the after party.</small></center-->

Wroclove.rb was one of the best conferences we've attended. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/show/?q=wrocloverb">Great talks, great party, and most importantly, the best people</a>! Without all of you, this event would be nothing! The level of the talks was very high and we had a lots of fun at the after parties. We're looking forward to have a Wroclove.rb 2013 next year.
