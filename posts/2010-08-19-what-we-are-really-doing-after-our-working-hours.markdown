This is a very short post about what is railslove doing after working hours. Yes, we're drinking beer, playing urban terror or somking cigars and thinking about "how we do spend our next million"....

Yeah.. and what is railslove really doing? The short answer is: coding, thinking about really hot applications and having a lot of fun to work with our team.

But now we're trying something new: Railslove Research (short: RR). So we started a small independent blog, where we want to find out, how to do apis more usable and flexible for developers. Just visit our blog: <a href="http://arrrpi.posterous.com/">http://arrrpi.posterous.com</a> (and of course we're building a sexy application around that...)
