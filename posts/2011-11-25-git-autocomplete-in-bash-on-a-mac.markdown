I've been using Linux and bash for great chunk of time for web development, and it always had great features like autocomplete, that I didn't get by default on a Mac.

So, I've decided to take matters into my on hands, and leave a post for all those, who are also bugged by no git autocomplete in bash on a Mac.

Thankfully, git already <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash">has its autocomplete script</a>, so it's a matter of just two commands:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1393106.js?file=bash-autocomplete-script"></script>

But I like to take it one step beyond. To save some keystrokes, I've added some aliases to my <tt>~/.gitconfig</tt>:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1393106.js?file=git-aliases"></script>

Now I can tab on <tt>git co <branch_name></tt> and everywhere else I was used to on my Linux machine.
