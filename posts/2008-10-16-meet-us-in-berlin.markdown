It seems like Berlin is the center of the web world this october. With <a href="http://barcampberlin3.mixxt.org/">BarCamp Berlin 3</a>, <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/webexberlin2008/">Web 2.0 expo</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=11222753500&ref=ts">FaceBook Developer Garage</a>, <a href="http://webmontag.de">WebMontag</a>, <a href="http://girlgeekdinner.de/">Girl Geek Dinner</a>, <a href="http://pl0gbar.de">Pl0gbar</a>, etc. the calendar in Berlin is pretty packed and really awesome events are ahead of us. 
<p>
The whole Railslove crowd is going to Berlin on Friday. We will be at the Barcamp, Facebook Developer Garage and perhaps Webmontag. Unfortunately I need to go back to Cologne on Tuesday.

<p>
I'm honestly a bit worried about the Barcamp and I'm wondering if that Barcamp is still a BARCAMP. - With more than 500 people coming and a list of sponsors that is probably the longest I've ever seen. ( some people say you only get XXL barcamp shirts - otherwise there is not enough space for the list of sponsors.;) ) - But anyway that's another story and <strong>I'm really looking forward to meet</strong> all the web crowd. It'll be a big party. ;)
