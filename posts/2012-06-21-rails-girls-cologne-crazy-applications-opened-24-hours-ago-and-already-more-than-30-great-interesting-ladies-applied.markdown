As you might already know, Liane and I went to Rails Girls Berlin in April this year and we had an awesome time. We especially enjoyed the vibrant and inspiring atmosphere and were amazed by all the energy and creativity! So we decided to bring Rails Girls to Cologne!
In case you haven‘t heard about Rails Girls yet: Rails Girls is a workshop where women and girls can learn how to write a Rails application from scratch. It aims to give them the tools and vocabulary to build the web as they see it. The focus is on building things, not only programming, so the curriculum also includes some design and marketing flavors. Best: no previous knowledge needed. Even better: it’s non-profit, that means totally free for participants!
So if you’re interested in participating, fill in the application form on <a title="rails girls cologne" href="http://railsgirls.com/cologne">http://railsgirls.com/cologne</a> (Applications are open until the 10th of September).
And if you are already into Rails or Ruby, you can also join the coaches team. Right now we are especially looking for female coaches ;) Sponsoring is very welcome, too.

For more information just check out the <a href="http://railsgirls.com/cologne">Website </a>or follow us on twitter @railsgirls_cgn.

We're so much looking forward to the event!
