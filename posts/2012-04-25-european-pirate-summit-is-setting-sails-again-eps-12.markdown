<h2>What is EPS?</h2>
In 2011, the first European Pirate Summit took place. EPS is a meetup for innovators and adventurers. It's a conference about people that have stories to tell. EPS is about stealing gold and taking over the world. It's about pirates like The Horrid Slave and his crew! Best have a look at this short video from last year's event:

<h2>Are you a pirate?</h2>
If you want to join the crew... learn to speak like a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWgxuc45YCY">pirate</a>, read <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/10/31/are-you-a-pirate/">this</a> article, prepare <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/dmc500hats/startup-metrics-for-pirates-brazil-nov-2011?ref=http://piratesummit.com/who%E2%80%99s-a-pirate/">presentations like this</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=dFBBKfw59kA">listen to this song</a> over and over again. The last step is to send out <a href="http://piratesummit.com/applicationregistration/">this application</a>. But what are real pirates doing?

<strong>They are drinking rum and hacking sites like this one: <a href="http://railslove.com/arrr">http://railslove.com/arrr</a>!</strong>

And because Railslove loves the EPS our <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/railslove_dj">Railslove DJ</a> will play <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=dFBBKfw59kA">this song</a> over and over again and we will keep this site until some other pirates are hijacking our website. Try it... you lose! ARRR!

<h2>Say Ahoy! to EPS in September 2012</h2>

This year about 500 EPS pirates are taking over Cologne on 10-11th of September.

What do you can expect this year? First of all... awesome captains like Fred Oliveira of <a href="http://500.co/">500 startups</a>,<a href="http://blog.railslove.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Pirate-summit.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1479" title="The European Pirate Summit" src="http://blog.railslove.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Pirate-summit.gif" alt="The European Pirate Summit" width="100" height="100" /></a>
 Andreas Ehn, 1st CTO of <a href="http://www.spotify.com/">Spotify</a> and current CTO of <a href="https://www.wrapp.com/de/">Wrapp</a>, and Frank Thelen of <a href="https://doo.net/">doo</a>. But stay tuned... <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvZWqFSFdvs">the message in the bottle</a> is still on its way to some other seadogs!

Like last year there will be a <a href="http://piratesummit.com/pitch-application/">pitch competition (apply now!)</a>.

<h2>Young pirates are the future - EPS Scholarship</h2>
As we know - we need more pirates. And young pirates are learning quick. If your dream is taking over the startup world one day, best start learning as early as possible! So together with EPS we're searching young talent to bring fresh ideas aboard. We'll teach the all the required skills to craft their own businesses one day - pirate style! Railslove will be helping out with coding workshops for kids this year - check out the <a href="http://university.railslove.com">Railslove University page</a> for more details soon. We've already successfully organised <a href="http://university.railslove.com/courses/1">Ruby-on-Rails-from-Scratch courses in the past</a> for students. We believe that <a href="https://github.com/blog/1034-kids-are-the-future-teach-em-to-code">kids are the future</a>, so let's provide them all the tools and knowledge they need! More dojos, more pirate training camps, more kick-ass teaching, more mayhem, more ARRRRRRRR - ARRRRRR!
Imagine a world of 18-year-young captains setting sails for exciting new waters!

Godspeed!
