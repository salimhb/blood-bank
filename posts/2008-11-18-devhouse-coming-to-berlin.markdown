<p>I was so excited when <a href="http://upstream-berlin.com/2008/11/13/introducing-devhouseberlin/">this message</a> popped up in my feed reader: <strong>SuperHappyDevHouse is coming to Berlin</strong>.</p>
<p>
The event is taking place <strong>December 6th & 7th, 2008</strong>
<a href="http://upstream-berlin.com">Upstream Berlin</a> and all the <a href="http://boxhagener119.de/">Boxhagener 119</a> will open up their offices for a "fun-packed weekend of hacking". <br />
</p>

<blockquote>"SuperHappyDevHouse is a non-exclusive event intended for creative and curious people interested in technology. We&acirc;??re about knowledge sharing, technology exploration, and ad-hoc collaboration. Come to have fun, build things, learn things, and meet new people. It&acirc;??s called hacker culture, and we&acirc;??re here to encourage it."</blockquote>

We've organized a bit more <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/bumi/sets/72157600934731659/">conferency DevHouse</a> last year here in Cologne, which was really, really awesome. <br />
So if you have any chance to participate - do it!</p>
