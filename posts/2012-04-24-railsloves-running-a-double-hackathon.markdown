Let's dedicate this week to hacking on our own projects! We‘ll start
with the first Railslove Hackathon and will directly carry on with
Advanced Hackathon at the weekend. Railslove Hackathon will start at 10
a.m. on Wednesday. After the meet and greet we‘ll split into small teams
and will start working on the 3 or 4 most interesting projects. After a
lunch break we'll carry on coding like there was no tomorrow ;)
On Thursday we're starting with short presentations of first results and
will continue coding until the evening. After some serious keyboard
workout and mindboggling Ruby, JavaScript and what have not stunts,
there's no better way to unwind than some epic bowling action! Feel free
to join us at Alpha Bowling: <a href="http://www.alpha-bowling.de/">http://www.alpha-bowling.de</a>

For the Advance Hackathon, developers from all over North
Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) will meet from Friday to Sunday at our office, the
Gasmotorenfabrik Deutz! We'll get started with a kick-off meeting and
drinks on Friday evening. During the following two days, groups of 8-10
developers will hack on exciting projects and fight for cool awards!
