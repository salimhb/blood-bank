Today a nice option for the routes was <a href="http://github.com/rails/rails/commit/44a3009ff068bf080de6764a8c884fbf0ceb920e">commited to the Rails edge</a>.

map.resources now allows the option :only and :except to specify which routes should be created. Both options accept :none, :all, one action name or an array of action names.
For example:
<pre lang="rails">
map.resources :user, :only => :create
# GET /users fails
# only POST /users is available

map.resources :comments, :except => [:update, :destroy]
# GET /comments etc. works
# PUT /comments/1  fails
# DELETE /comments/1 fails
</pre>

If you have a lot of resources in your routes this allows you to cut memory consumption.
