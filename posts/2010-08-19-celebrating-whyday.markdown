<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_the_lucky_stiff">why the lucky stiff</a> was the persona of an anonymous and prolific writer, cartoonist, musician, artist, and computer programmer.(wikipedia) He was one of the key figures in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)">Ruby</a> community and helped to build what the Ruby community is today. He gave the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)">Ruby</a> community the spirit of freedom, whimsy and most notably creativity. 
On August 19, 2009 he withdrew from the online community. He shut down all his online presence including his Github, Twitter Accounts, the sites he maintained, etc. Since then his work has been collected at the <a href="http://whymirror.github.com/">whymirror on Github</a>. 

The Ruby community wishes him well and celebrates Whyday today to remember Why's contributions to the community and culture.

Happy whyday!
