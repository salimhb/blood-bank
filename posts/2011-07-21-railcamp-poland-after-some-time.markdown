In April, we, in cooperation with few Rails community companies, have organized the first edition of <a href="http://railscamp.pl">Railscamp Poland</a>. Railscamp Poland took place in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wis%C5%82a">Wisła</a>, the same Wisła where <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Ma%C5%82ysz">Adam Małysz</a>, a legendary former ski jumper, is from. We are very happy how the event turned out, and that many people spoke well about the organization of it.

So, right now, when I look back at the event, what do I see?

I see happy people, getting together, in one case, to have a good time while doing what they like! And all the time we did just that. There was a bit of coding, but mostly we had fun playing Guitar Hero, singing, playing Urban Terror.

Some quick (and not entirely accurate) facts about Railscamp Poland:

During the event, people:
<ul>
	<li>drank 20 liters of vodka,</li>
	<li>drank 40 liters of Club Mate,</li>
	<li>eaten 50 kilograms of pizzas,</li>
	<li>eaten 120 sausages,</li>
	<li>got 250 euro from a deposit for returned beer bottles,</li>
	<li>wrote daily 4000 lines of code (including 2600 while drinking), which test coverage is at 100%</li>
</ul>

Again, big thanks to these guys for making this possible:
