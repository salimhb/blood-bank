Since 2008 we have been building web applications for you. We've done some really great projects with our partners and we're happy to see our own web service, channelthing, growing. So, we think it is time to introduce ourselves in more than 140 chars.

As you might know, we three, Tim, Michael and I, started Railslove two years ago. However, in our project we work with many other great web developers who deserve to get mentioned. So, to give you a better insight into our network, we're going to reveal the "Railslove Family" over the next few weeks.

Yours,
Jan, Tim and Michael
