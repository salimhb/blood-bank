In one of our projects we've used <a href="https://github.com/railslove/Scalarium-CLI">Scalarium CLI gem</a> for an automatic deployment to amazon ec2 servers in combination with our <a href="https://github.com/defunkt/cijoe">CI Server - CIJoe</a>. Its really easy.

The only thing to do is to require the Scalarium CLI and the scalarium.yml in your setup recipe:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/777585.js?file=gistfile1.rb"></script>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/777589.js?file=gistfile1.rb"></script>

Then use your 'build worked' template (e.g.: build_worked.erb) to fire the deployment after your app was successful build:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/777590.js?file=gistfile1.txt"></script>

Thats it!
