Hey there,

there's so much going on at Railslove at the moment, we've felt it's really time for another update here on the blog.

First of all, it's a great pity that <a href="http://twitter.com/mkorfmann">Manuel</a> is leaving Railslove (hopefully just for a while?), because he decided to focus on finishing school for now -- even though I'm sure he'll keep rubying with passion like he did at Railslove. Thanks for working, hacking and sharing skills with us, Manuel. Hope to see you soon at one of our next hack-ups @cowoco.

Next up is <a href="http://www.salesking.eu/">SalesKing</a>. Some of you may know <a href="http://twitter.com/killerG">Georg</a> and the heavy-duty billing application he's been building for years now. After a long friendship, <a href="http://blog.railslove.com/2009/06/02/railslove-und-salesking-suchen-ein-neues-zuhause/">shared offices</a> (back in 2008), the creation of <a href="http://blog.railslove.com/2009/05/23/devhousefriday-mit-gary-vaynerchuk-yehuda-katz-und-scotland-on-rails/">DevHouseFriday</a> (in 2009) and now with Time2King a first shared project, it finally happened last week, that Railslove has become an official shareholder of SalesKing. We're very happy about our first investment (even though we're working with funded start-ups all the time, this is new to us) and the new involvement into the upcoming development of SalesKing, that comes with it. With Georg as visionary lead developer Railslove is now the new development team of SalesKing.

And there's good news from <a href="http://9flats.com/">9flats</a> for us: Together with Stephan Uhrenbacher and his managing team we agreed on a common future. Since 9flats is still growing at light speed and ideas and challenges don't seem to decrease at all, it will definitely be an exciting time for us. Thanks a lot for your great work until now, dear 9flats team, Stephan and his team know that their success and growth is also due to your dedication. Keep on rocking, Lena, Stephan, Jakob, Ralph, Jan, Lars and Tim!

But 9flats has always been just one of our major projects, and also our <a href="http://payango.com/">Payango</a> team has a good reason to celebrate soon, because Payango 3, the ultimate, most advanced, fastest and shiniest Payango-System ever built is about to launch! After months of conception work and development I can't wait to see this complete rewrite of their whole business application suite run in a production environment. While Payango 2 has "just" been a blown-up Rails application with a few white label frontends, Payango 3 will consist of several own backend and frontend web services, it will include new external services, new business partners and it will at all be the powerful technical future for all the crazy ideas the Payango guys are working on atm. Be on the lookout for <a href="http://www.facebook.com/kiscard">KisCARD</a>, which will be the first Payango 3-based frontend running on the new infrastructure. Also, thank you for your great work and tireless efforts, dear Payango team aka "triple-B" Basti, Bartek, Bumi + Jan and Lars. Can't wait. Can't wait.

Ahm, by the way, did you know that Railslove took over the active development and maintenance of <a href="http://www.avocadostore.de/">Avocado Store</a> some month ago? Well, I have to admit, I almost forgot about that, too, because Lars silently uses his sustainable coding skills to keep everything working just like it should. Kudos, Lars!

What else? Well, our incredible <a href="http://awesomebotfactory.com/">Awesome Bot Factory</a> will *soon* be launched based on - wait for it - node.js! Bumi kindly asked me to put it in the blog post, so he and Lars feel a little productive pressure to finally deliver somewhere along the way... ;-)

Upcoming Events, you should keep in mind:

* 10|11|12|13|14th August 2011: <a href="http://events.ccc.de/camp/2011/wiki/Ruby_Village">Ruby Village @ Chaos Communication Camp 2011</a> thankfully initiated by Basti
* 27th - 29th August 2011: node.js ko with @cowoco being an <a href="http://nodeknockout.com/locations">official knockout location</a>, so come around to hack! 

Yeah, and that's what we have for you today. Thanks for reading and hope to see/read/hack with you soon.
