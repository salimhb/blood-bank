Here at Railslove, we love building web applications. But aside from our core business, we also help other startups understand how the web works and what it means to run a web business -- in Hamburg, Berlin, Cologne. And since experienced Ruby on Rails developers are increasingly hard to find, we've started to offer apprenticeships, too.

One of our new partners is <a href="http://dailydeal.de/">DailyDeal</a>. We've done some beginners and advanced courses in Rails covering stuff like testing, building APIs, advanced JavaScript coding and general design and programming patterns in Ruby on Rails, etc.

<a href="https://www.xing.com/profile/Oliver_Hepfner">Oliver Hepfner</a>, Director Software Engineering of <a href="http://dailydeal.de/">DailyDeal</a>:
<blockquote>The training Railslove provided under the direction of Georg Leciejewski helped us understand advanced programming patterns in Ruby on Rails. Our developers were excited to get a hands-on introduction into Ruby on Rails.</blockquote>
&nbsp;

Next month, we will launch a few more courses with <a href="http://railslove.com/items/daily_deal">DailyDeal</a> and with other companies, like <a href="http://adcloud.com">Adcloud GmbH</a> in Germany. If you are interested in learning more, please contact Ralph and Georg: ralph AT railslove.com & gl AT salesking.eu & team AT railslove.com
