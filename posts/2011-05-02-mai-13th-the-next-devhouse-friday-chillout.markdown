DevHouseFriday is an event intended for creative and curious people interested in technology inspired by SuperHappyDevHouse. Once a month (on fridays) we talk about technology and share our knowledge while meeting new people and learning stuff we are all interested in.

Everyone had troubles while writing code. We need people they can tell us that special experience with us.

What kind of trouble? How did you resolved it? Tell us everything!
