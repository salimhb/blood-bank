We're proud to announce <a href="http://wrocloverb.com/">wroc_love.rb 2012</a>. The very first of such conferences in a beautiful city of Wrocław. What is this conference about?

<blockquote>A fresh Ruby conference organized by thriving local Ruby community. We're keen on experimenting, value original ideas and diversity of opinions - as long as they're backed with valid arguments.</blockquote>

You can meet : <a href="http://twitter.com/killerg">Georg</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/bumi">Bumi</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/holek_">Mike</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/ralph">Ralph</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/koos">myself</a> and our friend <a href="http://twitter.com/apotnick">Nick</a>. 

<h2>We're giving a talk</h2>
What is our talk about? About.. <em>"Pit .. Brad Pit..Pit's..ahhr! Just get out of the trap!!!"</em> In our talk we will share some of the most interesting, absurd, or funny moments and insights we have experienced in past couple of years. As developers and business founders, we present the best of our own mistakes and show you how we got out of the pits we fell into. Believe us, we’ve been there as well and, hopefully, attending our talk will help you not make our mistakes. ;) It will be a serious fun! The talk will cover both technical and other subjects. Each mistake will get a 2-3 min coverage. Read more about us and our talk at <a href="http://wrocloverb.com/">the conference page</a> and on their <a href="http://blog.wrocloverb.com/post/16577304388/railslove-salesking">blog</a>.

<h2>We love punk rock</h2>
Did you know we have our own band? No? Ok... now you know it! We're proud to indroduce you to...
