<a href="http://blog.railslove.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/rg-berlin.png"><img src="http://blog.railslove.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/rg-berlin.png" alt="Rails Girls Berlin" title="Rails Girls Berlin" width="300" height="306" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1279" /></a>On the 13/14th of April, Railslove will help to bring a very special Rails event to you: <a href="http://railsgirls.com/berlin">Railsgirls</a> will take place in Berlin!

Railsgirls is a workshop where women can learn how to write a Rails application from scratch. It aims to give them the tools and vocabulary to build the web as they see it. The focus is on building things, not only programming, so the curriculum also includes some design and marketing flavors. Best: no previous knowledge needed. Even better: it's non-profit, that means totally free for participants!

Quoting Karri Saarinen, one of the organisers:

<blockquote>The Internet was built by and for boys. As a girl, one often feels like lacking the vocabulary to access it. With Rails for Girls, we want to demystify the world of web applications and encourage women to learn about software development and programming. We believe that women need the skills and language to understand that world.</blockquote>

Before, Railsgirls already took place in Helsinki, Singapore and Shanghai, where it helped some 100 women building their first Ruby on Rails application. Check out some of the <a href="http://railsgirls.com/materials">presentations and results of those past events</a>.

Among other well known local Berlin Ruby developers, Lena from Railslove will be one of the coaches. This means the participants can not only listen to high quality presentations, but will also be guided step by step through the material in small groups.

If you're interested in participating, fill in the <a href="http://railsgirls.com/berlin">application form</a> on their website. You have time to do so until the 4th of April. Men can also apply when they're accompanied by a woman, but women will be given priority when there are more applicants than spaces (and there are already more than 50 applications for Berlin, and counting).

If you are already into Rails or Ruby, you can also join the coaches team. Sponsoring is still welcome, too (Railslove is helping out with covering costs for the venue). Next events up are Tallinn, Vienna, Krakow, Buenos Aires and Helsinki again - if you want to suggest your city, drop the organisers an email.

<a href="http://railsgirls.com/berlin">See you there!</a>
