Last weekend, as a long-standing <a href="http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Holek">Polish Wikipedian</a>, I went to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poznań">Poznań</a> to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Polish Wikipedia.

The event started on Friday, September 23th and went on until Monday, September 26th, the actual date of establishing Polish Wikipedia. During that time, I've met old friends, colleagues, and newcomers to our project. The event took place in <a href="http://multikino.pl/pl/wszystkie-kina/poznan-stary-browar/o-kinie/">Multikino cinema</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stary_Browar">Shopping, Arts and Business Center "Stary Browar"</a> (<abbr title="literally">lit.</abbr> "Old Brewery"), a place dating back to 1844, when Ambrosius Hugger, a Wirtembergian brewer, came to Poznań to start his brewery there.

Almost 200 people came to celebrate with us and to participate in talks and presentations, making it the biggest Wikipedia meet-up in Poland so far. As usual, there were also guests from other countries: we were visited by Wikipedians from Germany, Czech, Belarus, Philippines, Hungary, Ukraine and Russia. On Friday we spent time on getting together, drinking beer and organizing our stay in hostels.

The actual event started on Saturday with a discussion between founders of Polish Wikipedia, Paweł Jochym and Krzysztof Jasiutowicz, who told us about the beginnings of Polish Wikipedia and how they imagine its future. What's worth noting this is also the first time these founders actually met each other. Before now they only collaborated on the encyclopedia online, and we've never seen them together during one conference. Other speakers included: Jan Wróbel (a contributor to a weekly newsmagazine <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wprost">Wprost</a>), Piotr Marcinkowski (vicepresident of Library of University of Poznań), Sylwia Ufnalska (translator and science journalist), Jarosław Lipszyc (president of Modern Poland Foundation) and Edwin Bendyk (famous editor, blogger and journalist).

We also had a chance to see a documentary <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_in_Numbers%3F"><em>Truth in Numbers? Everything, According to Wikipedia</em></a>, which explores the history and cultural implications of the online user-editable encyclopedia Wikipedia. The film attempts to answer the question of whether all kinds of individuals or just experts should be tasked with editing an encyclopedia.

Apart from that, there was a surprise made by Wikimedia Polska Association for all editors: a video with congratulations on the anniversary from famous Polish people:

Congratulations for our work were given from: Polish president Bronisław Komorowski, professor Jerzy Bralczyk, Bartłomiej Chaciński, Ilona Łepkowska, Marek Niedźwiecki, Krzysztof Skowroński, Mariusz Szczygieł and Ewa Wachowicz. President Komorowski encouraged to edit Wikipedia and share the knowledge, Mariusz Szczygieł and Marek Niedźwiecki admitted Wikipedia helps them in their work, and professor Bralczyk expressed his pride in Polish Wikipedia being one of the biggest language version of this encyclopedia.

And thus, the event concluded on Sunday, with a group photo of all the attendees, after which all of us started going home, tired, but happy after seeing each other again, hoping we can make the best of this great project, to which we contributed over past decade. And that is what I wish to Polish Wikipedia for this and next decades to come! Let's make the best encyclopedia ever!
