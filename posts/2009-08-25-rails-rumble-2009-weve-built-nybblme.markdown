Phew! That was exciting. <a href="http://railsrumble.com">Rails Rumble 2009</a> - the 48 hour web application development competition- is over.
</p>
We teamed up with Rany (aka <a href="http://twitter.com/purzelrakete">@purzelrakete</a>) to build the best team I can imagine.<br />
Our idea is as simple as powerful: (from your <a href="http://r09.railsrumble.com/teams/fuck-yeah">team description</a>)
<blockquote>
nybbl.me is a microlearning plattform. get twitter sized nibbles of information sent to you, like "you can parse json 2x as fast with the yajl-ruby gem. check it on github.". choose a set, like "rails active record", and get schooled over the next days.

create, share and remix nybbl sets, and get them pushed to your iphone. if you prefer, you can grab them per email or sms, too.

nybbl is learning, the easy way: sweat not included.

</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>Think of your private teacher who teaches you in twitter sized micro lessons throughout the day. </strong><br />
Everyone can create those sets of lessons and publish them on the nybbl app store.  Most of the sets are free but publishers can choose a price between 0.99$ and 9.99$. <br />
nybbl.me will deliver these nybbls to every subscriber via iphone push notification, sms, twitter or email. 
</p>
<p>
We will post more information and a screencast about <a href="http://nybbl.me">nybbl.me</a> in the next days. <br />
For now you should check out <a href="http://nybbl.me">nybbl.me</a> and all the <a href="http://r09.railsrumble.com/teams">incredible apps</a> that were built within the 2 days.<br />
<p>
A huge thanks goes out to all the organizers and sponsors of the Rails Rumble for the awesome weekend.
